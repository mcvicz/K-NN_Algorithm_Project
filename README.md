============== K-NN Algorithm Project ==============

Educational project aiming to implement the **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** algorithm from scratch and compare its performance with the `scikit-learn` library.

==============Project Structure ==============

* **`.pytest_cache/`** – Temporary directory generated by `pytest`, storing test execution history (ignored by git).
* **`notebooks/`**
    * `KNN_experiments.ipynb` – Interactive Jupyter Notebook used for experiments and manual analysis execution.
* **`src/`** – Main project source code.
    * `__pycache__/` – Compiled Python files (`.pyc`) for faster execution (ignored by git).
    * `__init__.py` – Empty file marking the directory as a Python package.
    * `knn.py` – File containing the `KNNClassifier` class implementation (algorithm logic).
* **`tests/`** – Set of unit tests.
    * `__pycache__/` – Compiled test files (ignored by git).
    * `test_knn.py` – File with tests verifying the correctness of the KNN algorithm.
* **`venv/`** – Local virtual environment containing installed libraries (not part of the repository).
* **`.gitignore`** – Git configuration file specifying which files and folders should be ignored (e.g., `venv`, `__pycache__`).
* **`benchmark_accuracy.png`** – Plot generated by the script, comparing the accuracy of your model with `sklearn`.
* **`benchmark_prediction_times.png`** – Plot generated by the script, comparing prediction times of both models.
* **`benchmark_results.csv`** – CSV file containing raw results of time and accuracy measurements.
* **`pytest.ini`** – Configuration file for `pytest` (defines test output format).
* **`README.md`** – Main project documentation (this file).
* **`requirements.txt`** – List of all external libraries required to run the project.
* **`run_benchmark.py`** – Main script automating the performance testing and report generation process.

============== Installation and Configuration ==============

To run the project, you need to create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

 1. Cloning the repository

git clone [https://github.com/mcvicz/K-NN_Algorithm_Project.git](https://github.com/mcvicz/K-NN_Algorithm_Project.git)
cd K-NN_Algorithm_Project

 2. Creating a virtual environment (venv) 

It is recommended to use an isolated environment to avoid library conflicts.

===== Linux / macOS / WSL: =====

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

===== Windows: =====

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

 3. Installing libraries

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Running tests

Code quality is verified using *pytest*. Tests check the correctness of calculations (Euclidean distance, voting, fitting).

To run the tests, type in the terminal:

pytest

Expected result: all tests green (PASSED).

============== Benchmark (Performance Comparison) ==============

To compare our implementation with sklearn, we use the Python script run_benchmark.py.

Run the benchmark with the command:

python run_benchmark.py

The script will perform the following actions:

I Test both algorithms on 4 datasets (Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer, Digits).
II Display the results table in the terminal.
III Save results to the benchmark_results.csv file.
IV Generate and save comparison plots (benchmark_accuracy.png, benchmark_prediction_times.png).
